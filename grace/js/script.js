		'Carles de Gualle was a Frenchman born in 1890, in Lillie, France into a wealthy and growing family of five at the time. His mother came from wealth, and his father was a successful history professor and founder of a school. He was highly influenced by his father \ and his uncle, also named Charles de Gualle, who was a historian and had an interest in military tactics. As he came into a family of scholars, he became highly literate and informed of French history at a young age, and having philosophical discussions about war and war tactics in his home led to his aspirations to have a military career.

After this event he made tactical suggestions that were turned down by his higher-ups, but that was only the beginning for his military career. In between the first and second world war, Charles de Gaulle continued his education more formally at a military school until France was invaded by Nazi Germany in around 1939, when the second world war had begun.',

During his first battle, his army barely escaped defeat. Later on he took around 400 Nazi prisoners in order for his soliders to escape the area safely. Fighting back against Hitlor and contributing to the fight to maintain order in the world was far more important than the risk of loss. Through the leadership of de Gaulle the soldiers understood why they were fighting, and put more trust into his tactics and plans, as he has shown his skill and intelligence on the battlefield.',

He believed that through strategies and mobilization, they would be able to overcome the odds that were against them, and be able to take back control and power over their land, but they were facing serious issues. These issues included extreme geographic disadvantages and a lack of mobilization. This made it extremely difficult for his army and he began to implement his own tactics that were unlike traditional trench fighting tactings. Instead he used modern techniques comparable to those of Germanyâ€™s. Despite his great efforts, the French government began to surrender to Germany, which caused de Gaulle to flee to London.',
